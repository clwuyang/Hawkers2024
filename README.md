# Windy City Whispers

Hi! We are Windy City Whispers, we built a smart travel platform powered by Large Language Models, providing a more customized touristic experience.


**Purpose:** Most travel apps provide generic recommendations. We want to tailor suggestions to enhance user experience.

**Personalization:** Based on user input, give tailor-made suggestions.
Unique experience:  Focusing on lesser-known activities to provide travelers with more authentic experiences and want to explore a city beyond its typical tourist attractions.

**Engagement:**  Conversational experience that feels more personal and responsive, like talking to a knowledgeable local.

**Dynamic Content:** Updated database based on user feedback.
